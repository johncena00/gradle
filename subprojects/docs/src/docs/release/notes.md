### Stricter validation with `validateTaskProperties`

Cacheable tasks are validated stricter than non-cacheable tasks by the `validateTaskProperties` task, which is added automatically by the [`java-gradle-plugin`](userguide/java_gradle_plugin.html).
For example, all file inputs are required to have a normalization declared, like e.g. `@PathSensitive(RELATIVE)`.
This stricter validation can now be enabled for all tasks via [`validateTaskProperties.enableStricterValidation = true`](javadoc/org/gradle/plugin/devel/tasks/ValidateTaskProperties.html#setEnableStricterValidation-boolean-).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

### Inherited configuration-wide dependency excludes are now published

Previously, only exclude rules directly declared on published configurations (e.g. `apiElements` and `runtimeElements` for the `java` component defined by the [Java Library Plugin](userguide/java_library_plugin.html#sec:java_library_configurations_graph)) were published in the Ivy descriptor and POM when using the [Ivy Publish Plugin](userguide/publishing_ivy.html) or [Maven Publish Plugins](userguide/publishing_maven.html), respectively.
Now, inherited exclude rules defined on extended configurations (e.g. `api` for Java libraries) are also taken into account.

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation
-->

### Setters for `classes` and `classpath` on `ValidateTaskProperties`

There should not be setters for lazy properties like `ConfigurableFileCollection`s.
Use `setFrom` instead.

    validateTaskProperties.getClasses().setFrom(fileCollection)
    validateTaskProperties.getClasspath().setFrom(fileCollection)
    
## Potential breaking changes

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->
### Worker API: working directory of a worker can no longer be set 

Since JDK 11 no longer supports changing the working directory of a running process, setting the working directory of a worker via its fork options is now prohibited.
All workers now use the same working directory to enable reuse.
Please pass files and directories as arguments instead.

### Passing arguments to Windows Resource Compiler

To follow idiomatic [Provider API](userguide/lazy_configuration.html) practices, the `WindowsResourceCompile` task has been converted to use the Provider API.

Passing additional compiler arguments now follow the same pattern as the `CppCompile` and other tasks.
